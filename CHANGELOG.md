# verison 2

# version 1
- [x] use fetch instead of atomic
- [x] move to kavun as test runner, faster, simpler, smaller
- [x] remove workshop banner
- [x] classnames seems to be used rarely
- [x] update react, maybe preact works fine?

- [x] simplify the deploy, travis has push to gh-pages built in
- [x] move to https://plausible.io/ instead of GA
- [x] show all ESX katas on the page

# version 0 
- [x] pre-render the index.html page at deploy time, so the rendering will be flying fast, only updates 
      will be applied to the DOM once the page was rendered on the client
- [x] separate server- and client-side rendering better, improve code
- [x] add analytics to the page - plausible was added
- [x] open tddbin in a new tab
